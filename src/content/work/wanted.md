I built this project using a native PHP MVC architecture and hand-written CSS, deliberately avoiding any frameworks to deepen my understanding of PHP and frontend development.

The site is fully responsive and provides functionality for both listing items for sale and searching for specific items. It also features a real-time chat system, implemented using Ratchet, to enhance user interaction.

I hope you enjoy exploring it.
Have fun!

Stack : HTML - CSS - Twig - PHP - Javascript - mySQL
