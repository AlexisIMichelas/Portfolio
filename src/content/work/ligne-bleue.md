In order to carry out my final project, which concludes my training at the wild code school, I had to create an application for La Banque Postale, including tutorials for people wishing to learn about digital. The application is responsive, includes a database with roles (admin/users), the user can search for a tutorial via categories, change his avatar and find the evolution of his progress on his profile

Stack : HTML - CSS (Bootstrap) - Twig - PHP (Symfony) - Javascript - mySQL
