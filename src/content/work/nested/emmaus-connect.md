The emmaus connect project required the creation of a web/mobile application, highlighting the phones available for resale. The application had a primary need, the creation of an algorithm to determine, according to certain criteria, the resale price of a phone.
This application is full stack (front-end and back-end) and composes a database.

Stack : HTML - CSS (Boostrap) - PHP (Symfony) - Twig - Javascript - MySQL
